Elle est connue pour avoir fait la promotion de la \"pose de pouvoir\", une technique d'auto-amélioration controversée. Elle a été membre du corps professoral de l'Université Rutgers, de la Kellogg School of Management et de la Harvard Business School. Le travail académique le plus cité de Cuddy se base sur l'utilisation d'un modèle de contenu stéréotypé qu'elle a aidé à développer, afin de mieux comprendre ce que les gens pensent des autres personnes et des groupes stéréotypés. \n\n------------------------------------------ \n\nIntervenante : \n\nAmy Cuddy : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcN-XD3TbODV18Ghb_G3DUg/featured\n\nTraduction française : Ascension Succès\n\n------------------------------------------ \n\nÀ propos d'Ascension Succès : \n\nSite Web  :  https://ascension-succes.fr/\nBlog : https://ascension-succes.fr/blog/\nFacebook : https://www.facebook.com/AscensionSucces/\n\n ------------------------------------------ \n\nN'oubliez pas de vous abonner, activer la cloche pour savoir dès qu'une nouvelle vidéo est publiée, et n'hésitez pas à liker et partager la vidéo ! \n\n ------------------------------------------ \n\n#AmyCuddy #LangageCorporel #Communication #NonVerbal",

Cognitive scientist Lera Boroditsky shares examples of language -- from an Aboriginal community in Australia that uses cardinal directions instead of left and right to the multiple words for blue in Russian -- that suggest the answer is a resounding yes. \"The beauty of linguistic diversity is that it reveals to us just how ingenious and how flexible the human mind is,\" Boroditsky says. \"Human minds have invented not one cognitive universe, but 7,000.\"\n\nCheck out more TED Talks: http://www.ted.com\n\nThe TED Talks channel features the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).
